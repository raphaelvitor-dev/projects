### Project 1: (My agency website) 🧩
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, Netlify, Calendly, ScrollReveal.js, Typed.js, CSS, HTML.

**Summary:** Since I needed a contact website for my freelance work, I quickly developed a front-end–focused landing page to showcase the agency's creativity and visual identity.  
The site is hosted on Netlify, which I also used to handle form submissions, allowing client messages to be delivered directly without a custom backend. Calendly is also integrated to manage bookings seamlessly through my calendar.  
*(Fun fact: all artwork, design elements, and layout concepts were created by me! 🎨)*
